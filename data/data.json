    "description": "Mature male from Colorado looking for female roommate to share 4 bed, 2 bath house, short or long term. Not looking for a relationship, I just prefer a female because my 16yr old daughter attending UC lives with me, my 14yr old daughter occasionally visits on a weekend and neither my ex nor myself want another dude around my daughters. It would be great to find another UC student but older roomies are welcome. I work in quality assurance for the aerospace industry and I'm a part-time photographer. Minimum 1-month stay.",
